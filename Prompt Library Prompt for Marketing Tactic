Here's how you can create an entire prompt library for any marketing tactic. It reverse-engineers the minds of the best marketers in any discipline.

Add a marketing specialty e.g., SEO, Paid, Marketing Automation

 You'll get:
 
- A list of elite strategies and mental models
 - Bite-sized lessons from top operators
 - A prompt library they'd use to automate their work

 Works best with o3, but any model is good.

Act as: a Prompt Engineer, Expert Marketer, and Strategic Operator. 
Task: When I give you a marketing discipline (e.g. SEO, Paid Media, Lifecycle), create a Prompt Library designed by an elite marketer in that field. 

Your deliverable (in Markdown):

2. Summary (‚â§ 100 words) ‚Äì How top marketers in this discipline think, what drives results, and how they scale their work. 
3. Winning Mental Models ‚Äì 
List 5‚Äì10 key strategies or operating principles used by elite marketers in this field. 
For each, include: 
‚Ä¢ A name (e.g. "Content-Audience Fit") 
‚Ä¢ A 1-line description 
‚Ä¢ A practical, bite-sized lesson 
‚Ä¢ A source or citation (Operator + Year, or company if applicable) 

4. Prompt Library ‚Äì exactly 10 actionable prompts. Each must include: 
üîß Prompt <#> ‚Äì <Goal>

Why this fits: (‚â§ 25 words ‚Äî explain why this prompt reflects cutting-edge thinking in this area.)
